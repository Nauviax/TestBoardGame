## Installing for Multiplayer

As we have added extra modules for multiplayer, you will need to run npm install form the terminal.
```
npm install
```

## Running the Multiplayer Server

In one terminal tab, start the multiplayer server:
```
npm start serve
```
Start a second terminal tab, and run the game code:
```
npm start
```
You should now have a browser tab to play the game. Open a second browser tab and you can play as both players.
