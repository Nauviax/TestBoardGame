Kiwi Kluedo Map Dictionary

All Tiles have a name and direction. This is represented by it's ID.
An ID will take the form <Name><Direction>, where the direction is the side that faces the inside of a building
A simple horisontal wall can have two different IDs, the difference is which side "Inside" is. (The IDs in this case are WN and WS)
You can either draw these IDs as the same solid wall, or a thin wall with carpet on the inside side (Or something)

Examples: (ASCII art for reference only)

...
...	Outside (O)
...

░░░
░░░	Inside (I)
░░░

...
███	Wall with inside on south side (WS)
░░░

...
█d█	Door with inside on south side (DS)
░░░

...
.██	Corner with inside on south east side (CSE)
.█░

░░░
░██	The same corner, but inverted. Inside now on north west side (CINW) (Corner Inverted North West)
░█.

You can represent these tiles however, the presented ASCII here is only for reference.
The entire dictionary follows below:

Non-wall tiles:
Inside (I)
Outside (O)
Player (0,1,2 etc)

Wall tiles:
Wall (WN, WS, WW, WE)
Door (DN, DS, DW, DE)
Corner (CNW, CNE, CSW, CSE)
Corner Inverted (CINW, CINE, CISW, CISE)

More items may be added later.

Defining a new room is a little weird right now. If you want to add more rooms, try and use these tile IDs in sets of 3x3 only. (So 3x6, 12x9 are all fine)
